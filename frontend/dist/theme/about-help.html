<h2 class="my-4">About & Help</h2>

<p>
  This website is feedback interface for <a href="https://github.com/osm-search/nominatim-ui">Nominatim UI</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The frontend runs standalone as website and will request data from a separate Nominatim API
  running on <code>Nominatim_API_Endpoint</code> and Nominatim-feedback-reporter API running on <code>Nominatim_Feedback_Reporter_API_Endpoint</code>
  and overpass-API running on <code>Overpass_API_Endpoint</code> (configurable, see below).
</p>

<p>
  Nominatim is a search engine for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data.
  You may search for a name or address (forward search) or look up data by its geographic coordinate
  (reverse search). Each result comes with a link to a details page where you can inspect what data
  about the object is saved in the database and investigate how the address of the object has been
  computed.
